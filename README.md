# 🤖 AI Image Classifier - Retro Edition

A retro-styled web application for real-time image classification using deep learning. Built with TensorFlow/Keras and deployed via Flask, featuring a nostalgic cartoon-comic aesthetic inspired by classic arcade gamesshowcasing the power of Convolutional Neural Networking.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset to classify images into 10 distinct categories. The model is wrapped in a Flask web application with an engaging retro UI that provides real-time predictions with confidence scores and class probability distributions.
